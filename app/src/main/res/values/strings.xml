    <string name="about_text">Blue Control is a basic universal Remote Control for Blue-Tooth enabled serial devices such as Blue Tooth modules connected to a microcontroller. For each button pressed the corresponding ASCII code for the label will be sent. For example pressing buttons A-H will send the charactes a - h. The up, down, left, right, and center buttons will send U,D,L,R, and C characters. Hopefully this will inspire people to create alot of fun Blue-Tooth Controlled devices.</string>
